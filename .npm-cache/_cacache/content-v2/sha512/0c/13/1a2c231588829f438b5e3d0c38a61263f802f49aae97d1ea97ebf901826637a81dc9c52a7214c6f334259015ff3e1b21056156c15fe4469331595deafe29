Functionality is also available via a Node.js API. Cross-platform - runs everywhere Node.js runs (linux, unix, mac OS X, windows)\n\nwait-on will wait for period of time for a file to stop growing before triggering availability which is good for monitoring files that are being built. Likewise wait-on will wait for period of time for other resources to remain available before triggering success.\n\nFor http(s) resources wait-on will check that the requests are returning 2XX (success) to HEAD or GET requests (after following any redirects).\n\nwait-on can also be used in reverse mode which waits for resources to NOT be available. This is useful in waiting for services to shutdown before continuing. (Thanks @skarbovskiy for adding this feature)\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)\n\n## Installation\n\nwait-on supports the Node.js versions that are active or in maintenance. See the list here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install wait-on # local version\nOR\nnpm install -g wait-on # global version\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nUse from command line or using Node.js programmatic API.\n\n### CLI Usage\n\nAssuming NEXT_CMD is the command to run when resources are available, then wait-on will wait and then exit with a successful exit code (0) once all resources are available, causing NEXT_CMD to be run.\n\nwait-on can also be used in reverse mode, which waits for resources to NOT be available. This is useful in waiting for services to shutdown before continuing. (Thanks @skarbovskiy for adding)\n\nIf wait-on is interrupted before all resources are available, it will exit with a non-zero exit code and thus NEXT_CMD will not be run.\n\n```bash\nwait-on file1 && NEXT_CMD # wait for file1, then exec NEXT_CMD\nwait-on f1 f2 && NEXT_CMD # wait for both f1 and f2, the exec NEXT_CMD\nwait-on http://localhost:8000/foo && NEXT_CMD # wait for http 2XX HEAD\nwait-on https://myserver/foo && NEXT_CMD # wait for https 2XX HEAD\nwait-on http-get://localhost:8000/foo && NEXT_CMD # wait for http 2XX GET\nwait-on https-get://myserver/foo && NEXT_CMD # wait for https 2XX GET\nwait-on tcp:4000 && NEXT_CMD # wait for service to listen on a TCP port\nwait-on socket:/path/mysock # wait for service to listen on domain socket\nwait-on http://unix:/var/SOCKPATH:http://server/a/foo # wait for http HEAD on domain socket\nwait-on http-get://unix:/var/SOCKPATH:http://server/a/foo # wait for http GET on domain socket\n```\n\n```\nUsage: wait-on {OPTIONS} resource [...resource]\n\nDescription:\n\n     wait-on is a command line utility which will wait for files, ports,\n     sockets, and http(s) resources to become available (or not available\n     using reverse flag). Exits with  success code (0) when all resources\n     are ready. Non-zero exit code if interrupted or timed out.\n\n     Options may also be specified in a config file (js or json). For\n     example --config configFile.js would result in configFile.js being\n     required and the resulting object will be merged with any\n     command line options before wait-on is called. See exampleConfig.js\n\n     In shell combine with && to conditionally run another command\n     once resources are available. ex: wait-on f1 && NEXT_CMD\n\n     resources types are defined by their prefix, if no prefix is\n     present, the resource is assumed to be of type 'file'. Resources\n     can also be provided in the config file.\n\n     resource prefixes are:\n\n       file:      - regular file (also default type). ex: file:/path/to/file\n       http:      - HTTP HEAD returns 2XX response. ex: http://m.com:90/foo\n       https:     - HTTPS HEAD returns 2XX response. ex: https://my/bar\n       http-get:  - HTTP GET returns 2XX response. ex: http://m.com:90/foo\n       https-get: - HTTPS GET returns 2XX response. ex: https://my/bar\n       tcp:       - TCP port is listening. ex: 1.2.3.4:9000 or foo.com:700\n       socket:    - Domain Socket is listening. ex: socket:/path/to/sock\n                    For http over socket, use http://unix:SOCK_PATH:URL_PATH\n                    like http://unix:/path/to/sock:http://server/foo/bar or\n                         http-get://unix:/path/to/sock:http://server/foo/bar\n\nStandard Options:\n\n -c, --config\n\n  js or json config file, useful for http(s) options and resources\n\n -d, --delay\n\n  Initial delay before checking for resources in ms, default 0\n\n --httpTimeout\n\n  Maximum time in ms to wait for an HTTP HEAD/GET request, default 0\n  which results in using the OS default\n\n-i, --interval\n\n  Interval to poll resources in ms, default 250ms\n\n -l, --log\n\n  Log resources begin waited on and when complete or errored\n\n -r, --reverse\n\n  Reverse operation, wait for resources to NOT be available\n\n -s, --simultaneous\n\n  Simultaneous / Concurrent connections to a resource, default Infinity\n  Setting this to 1 would delay new requests until previous one has completed.\n  Used to limit the number of connections attempted to a resource at a time.\n\n -t, --timeout\n\n  Maximum time in ms to wait before exiting with failure (1) code,\n  default Infinity\n  Use postfix 'ms', 's', 'm' or 'h' to change the unit.\n\n  --tcpTimeout\n\n  Maximum time in ms for tcp connect, default 300ms\n  Use postfix 'ms', 's', 'm' or 'h' to change the unit.\n\n  --httpTimeout\n\n  Maximum time to wait for the HTTP request, default Infinity\n  Use postfix 'ms', 's', 'm' or 'h' to change the unit.\n\n -v, --verbose\n\n  Enable debug output to stdout\n\n -w, --window\n\n  Stability window, the time in ms defining the window of time that\n  resource needs to have not changed (file size or availability) before\n  signalling success, default 750ms.

This is useful for waiting for services to shutdown before continuing.\n- cross platform - runs anywhere Node.js runs (linux, unix, mac OS X, windows)\n\n## Why\n\nI frequently need to wait on build tasks to complete or services to be available before starting next command, so this project makes that easier and is portable to everywhere Node.js runs.\n\n## Get involved\n\nIf you have input or
